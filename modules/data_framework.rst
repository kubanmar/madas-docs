.. _data_framework:

The data framework
==================================

The data framework is the basic building block of a data analysis workflow. Data that may be gathered from different sources can be stored in a local database, to provide a fixed source of data, which does not change, *e.g.* if the external data source is altered. Thus, the analysis is repeatable and the results retain reproducible.

You can learn more about backends in the :doc:`backend module description </modules/backend>`.

You can learn more about fingerprints in the :doc:`fingerprint module description </modules/fingerprint>`.

The remaining parameters and methods can be found below.
