The Similarity Data Framework
=======================================

This package attempts to provide a convenient, easy-to-use solution for the analysis of similarity relations between data entries.

It's main focus is on materials data, computed or measured in materials science.

A typical use case would be the analysis of a set of calculations in computational materials science (CMS).
